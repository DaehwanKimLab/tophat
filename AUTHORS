Cole Trapnell wrote the original TopHat program. TopHat is built on Bowtie,
  which was written by Ben Langmead and Cole Trapnell.
Daehwan Kim and Geo Pertea added support for SOLiD reads, Bowtie 2 and many 
  other features and improvements leading to the release of TopHat2, of which
  they are the current maintainers.

SAMtools version 0.1.18 is used in TopHat2 and its sources are included in 
  TopHat2's source release starting with version 2.0.13; SAMtools 0.1.18 was
  written primarily by Heng Li and Bob Handsaker.

  in TopHat source releases; its authors are Andreas Doring, David Weese, 
  Tobias Rausch, and Knut Reinert.
