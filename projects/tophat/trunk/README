TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads. It aligns RNA-Seq
reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra high-throughput short read
aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the mapping results to identify splice
junctions between exons.

TopHat is a collaborative effort between the University of Maryland Center for
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and the University of California,
Berkeley Departments of Mathematics and Molecular and Cell Biology.
