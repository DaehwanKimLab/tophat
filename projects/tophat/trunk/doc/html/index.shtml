    <strong>TopHat</strong> is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq 
  reads.  It aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the 
  ultra high-throughput short read aligner <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net">Bowtie</a>, and then analyzes the mapping results to identify splice junctions between exons. 
	  <br> <br>
	  TopHat is a collaborative effort between the <a href="http://genomics.jhu.edu">Institute of Genetic Medicine</a> 
      at Johns Hopkins University, the <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu">Departments of Mathematics</a> and

	  <h2>TopHat 2.0.8 release 2/26/2013</h2>
	  <p><b>Note (4/12/2013):</b> patched version 2.0.8b was released in order to provide compatibility with Bowtie v1.0.0</p>
	  <p> Version 2.0.8 is a quick fix release addressing the following issues:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li> This version correctly handles the newest version of Bowtie2 v2.1.0.
	    </li>
	    <li> The segment mapping slow-down introduced by some Bowtie2 parameter changes in version 2.0.7 is now corrected.
	    </li>
	</ul>
	  <br>
	    
	  <h2>TopHat 2.0.7 release 1/23/2013</h2>
	  <p> Version 2.0.7 is a maintenance release addressing some issues found in the earlier releases:
	</p><ul>
	    <li> Please update Bowtie1 or Bowtie2 to the latest released 
versions (0.12.9 and 2.0.5, respectively).
	    It may be necessary to download the latest Bowtie genome indexes 
and it is strongly recommended to remove&amp;rebuild the transcriptome 
indexes.
	    </li>
	    <li> The <code>-i/--min-intron-len</code> option now allows introns of length less than 50
	    </li>
	    <li> The <code>--no-mixed</code> option is now correctly handled. TopHat no longer produces singleton alignments when this option is used.
	    </li>
	    <li> Explicit mate pairing information (/1 or /2 suffix) in the 
read name in unmapped.bam is removed. The SAM flag provides the pairing 
information.
	    </li>
	    <li> TopHat spawned processes which sometimes showed the warning message like "<i>[main_samview] truncated file</i>" are now properly terminated.
	    </li>
	    <li> With a large number of reads and --fusion-search enabled, 
TopHat consumed a huge amount of memory, in particular, in 
long_spanning_reads program, which is now fixed.
	    </li>
	</ul>
	  <br>

	  <h2>TopHat 2.0.6 release 11/02/2012</h2>
	  <p> Version 2.0.6 is a maintenance release addressing some issues found in the 2.0.5 release:
	</p><ul>
	  <li> corrected the indel finding algorithm that caused segmentation fault in certain cases (long_spanning_reads and tophat_reports)
	   </li>
	  <li> fixed the Bowtie version checking code, adding support for newer, non-beta Bowtie2 versions</li><li>several minor fixes in the fusion alignment algorithm</li><li>fixed an incompatibility issue with Python versions older than 2.6 (restoring Python 2.4 compatibility)<br>
</li>
<li>fixed and improved the resuming option (-R/--resume) to better handle various failure/resume situations</li>
<li>added a warning about Bowtie1 and Bowtie2 index files in the same 
directory (causing trouble if they were built for different genomic 
sequences)<br>
</li>

	</ul>
	  <br>

	  <h2>TopHat 2.0.5 release 9/18/2012</h2>
	  <p>
	    Version 2.0.5 adds new options to better control the read alignment
 and to improve mapping accuracy, and the ability to resume partial 
TopHat runs:<br>
	  </p><ul>
	    
<li>along with <tt>-N/--read-mismatches</tt>, TopHat introduces new options for finer 
control of the read alignment process by limiting the number of mismatches, 
indels and indel length.&nbsp; 

Please check new options <a href="faq.shtml#edit_dist">--read-gap-length and --read-edit-dist</a>.<br>
</li>
<li>the new <a href="manual.shtml#read_realign">--read-realign-edit-dist</a> option can be used to greatly <a href="faq.shtml#accuracy">improve spliced-mapping accuracy</a>
 (especially in the absence of annotation data) by forcing the 
re-mapping of some or all reads regardless of them being already mapped 
in earlier steps of the pipeline.<br>
</li>

<li>we added the option to resume a TopHat run which was prematurely terminated:<tt><a href="manual.html#resume">-R/--resume &lt;tophat_out&gt;</a></tt></li>
  <li><tt>--transcriptome-mismatches</tt>&nbsp; and <tt>--genome-mismatches</tt> are now deprecated</li>

</ul>
	    <br>

	  <h2>TopHat 2.0.4 release 6/21/2012</h2>
	  <p> Version 2.0.4 is a maintenance release addressing some issues found in the 2.0.3 release:
	</p><ul>
	  <li>Fixed a bug that caused the last stage of TopHat (tophat_reports) to occasionally crash for large data sets.<br>
 </li>
	  <li>For paired reads found to be incorrectly paired in the input 
files TopHat now outputs a warning message instead of terminating with 
an error.<br>
</li>
	  <li>Alignments of paired reads mapped discordantly (e.g. on different
 chromosomes) are now reported by default.  To disable this behavior, 
--no-discordant option can be used.  Also please check --no-mixed option
 in the manual, which we borrow from Bowtie2 options.<br>
 </li><li>--fusion-search with Bowtie2 is still in developmental stage, 
it may require much memory space and produce many spurious fusions.
	    You may want to try a combination of --bowtie1 and --fusion-search 
if it does not work.</li>
	  <li> Environment variables such as BOWTIE_INDEXES and BOWTIE2_INDEXES
 are handled properly - please refer to the Bowtie website for more 
details about the variables. </li>
	  <li> Prebuilt transcriptome indexes built by older versions of TopHat
 may not be compatible with this version due to some internal changes in
 parsing gtf files.  It is strongly recommended to build a new 
transcriptome index.</li>
	</ul>
	  <br>
	    
	  <h2>TopHat 2.0.3 release 5/26/2012</h2>
	  <p> Users are strongly recommended to upgrade to this release as the 
source distribution and the binary versions of TopHat2.0.2 have some 
serious issues that cause runtime failure.
	  </p><br>

	  <h2>iGenomes index and annotation have been updated to include Bowtie2 indexes (in addition to Bowtie1 indexes) - 5/23/2012</h2>

	  <br>
	  <h2>TopHat 2.0.2 release 5/23/2012</h2>
	  <p> Version 2.0.2 is a maintenance release:
	  </p><p><strong>Note (9:50pm EST - 5/23):</strong> this version is slightly updated to remove some debugging code, which caused TopHat to exit abnormally.
	</p><ul>
	  <li> Fixed a bug TopHat2 aborts while reads overlapping with introns are being re-aligned, giving an error message like <br>
	  ./SeqAn-1.3/seqan/sequence/segment_infix.h:81 Assertion failed : 
data_begin_position &lt;= data_end_position was: 18446744073709551607 
&gt; 31</li>
	  <li> Some unique alignments were set as secondary alignments using 0x100 SAM flag, which is now fixed. </li>
	</ul>
	  
	  <br>
	  <h2>TopHat 2.0.1 maintenance release 5/17/2012</h2>
	  <p> Version 2.0.1 is a maintenance release addressing some issues found in the 2.0.0 release:
	</p><ul>
	  <li> Fixed the problem with some alignments in the BAM output (accepted_hits.bam) missing quality values. </li>
	  <li> The Read Group tag "RG" is now properly written for each alignment when using --rg-id and related options.</li>
	  <li> More strict checking for genomic coordinates is performed when retrieving spliced sequences. </li>
	  <li> Colorspace reads are now correctly handled (--color option).<br></li>
	  <li> Paired-end input reads are now checked for consistency (proper ordering in the input files).<br>
</li>
	  <li> Restored the functionality of options --no-sort-bam and --no-convert-bam.<br>
</li>
	  <li> --transcriptome-only option is correctly processed. </li>
	  <li> Some of alignments that overlap with introns are realigned against those corresponding splice sites.
	    If those new alignments are better than the previous alignments, they will be reported. </li>
	  <li> If the reference genome and the transcriptome files have the same prefix like genome (genome.fa and genome.gtf),
	    it caused some naming problems for chromosomes, which is now fixed. </li>
	  <li> Some of reads not present in neither accepted_hits.bam nor unmapped.bam are now reported correctly.</li>
	</ul>
	  <br>
	    
	  <h2>TopHat 2.0.0 release 4/09/2012</h2>
	  <p> Version 2.0.0 is a major release adding&nbsp; <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml">Bowtie 2</a> support,&nbsp; better parallelization and the ability to align RNA-Seq reads across potential fusion points.<br>
</p><ul>
	  <li> TopHat now uses Bowtie2 by default (if found in the system) 
although it can also fall back on Bowtie 1 (which is still required for 
SOLiD reads). <br>
</li>
<li>Bowtie 2 integration features:<br>
<ul>
	      <li> most of the optional SAM fields (AS, MD, NM, and etc.) 
generated by Bowtie 2 are now reported by TopHat as well (reconstructed 
as necessary)</li>
	      
	      <li> many of the Bowtie 2 options can now be directly given as TopHat options using <a href="manual.html#b2-option"><tt>--b2-&lt;bowtie option name&gt;</tt></a>.
		These apply to initial read mappings, not to segment mappings - please see the corresponding <a href="manual.html#b2-option">manual section</a>.</li></ul></li>
<li>
  <ul>

	    
  </ul>

	    TopHat 2 maps reads against transcriptome (optional), genome, and 
novel/known splice sites using Bowtie 2 (or 1)
	    in a fashion meant to increase the overall mapping sensitivity and 
accuracy.
	    In the case of Bowtie 2, reads poorly mapped in the initial stages 
(with lower scoring alignments due to indels etc.) will be made 
available for re-mapping in downstream stages. Alignments obtained in 
all participating stages are pooled and the best alignments will be 
finally reported for each read. Please note that this TopHat version 
requires the installation of Bowtie version 2.0.0-beta5 or later; also 
note that Bowtie1 and Bowtie2 indexes are different, so&nbsp;
	    it is necessary to use the new Bowtie 2 indexes with TopHat 2 
(unless --bowtie1 option is used or bowtie 2 is not found in the 
system). Since the iGenome Bowtie indexes do not include Bowtie 2 indexes,
 you may want to download Bowtie 2 indexes from <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml">the Bowtie2 website</a> or build them using bowtie2-build.
	  </li>

	  <li> Most of the time-consuming steps in the TopHat 2 pipeline are 
now parallelized, reducing the total running time substantially on 
multi-processor systems.<br>
</li>
	  <li> In addition to mapping across splice sites, TopHat 2 can now 
align reads across fusion points,
	    which usually occur due to genomic translocations, read-through 
transcription, or trans-splicing; Tophat 2 integrates the fusion 
discovery engine previously found in TopHat-Fusion&nbsp; 
(fusion mapping is optional, please see <a href="fusion_index.html">the separate page</a> for fusion mapping and the <tt><a href="manual.html#fusion">--fusion-...</a></tt> options in the manual).<br>
</li><li> Colorspace (SOLiD) reads require the older version of Bowtie, since Bowtie 2 does not provide support for this kind of reads.</li>
<li><tt>--closure-search</tt> and <tt>--butterfly-search</tt> options have been deprecated</li>

	  <li> In addition to reporting the best (or primary) alignments (the original TopHat behavior),
	    TopHat 2 can report the secondary alignments up to 20 (the default) paired or single alignments
	    (see --report-secondary-alignments and -g/--max-multihits)</li>
	  <li> The installation of the Boost package is now required in order to build TopHat 2 from source (see&nbsp; <a href="tutorial.html">Installation</a>).</li>
	  <li> New options affecting TopHat's output:</li>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;--keep-fasta-order (for those who prefer the order of 
reference sequences in the SAM output to match the order of the 
sequences in the genome fasta file) <br>
  </li>
  <li>--report-discordant-pair-alignments </li>
</ul>
  <li>  If you had some older versions of TopHat and TopHat-Fusion installed on your system,
    we suggest that you remove both programs before installing the new version and
    make sure that your system PATH includes the new version but does not include the other ones.
  </li>
	</ul>
	  <br>

	    <h2>Important notes - 3/26/2012</h2>
	  <p> For those who want to follow our <em>Nature Protocols</em>, we suggest users use TopHat 1.3.2 (see the download links below)
	    because TopHat 1.4.1 has some problems with running the protocols when mapping some of the simulated reads (e.g., C2_R2).
	    These problems do not happen with real data, so reverting back to TopHat 1.3.2 is not necessary.

	  <h2>TopHat and Cufflinks protocol published at Nature Protocols - 3/12/2012</h2>
	  <p>A complete <a href="http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n3/full/nprot.2012.016.html">bioinformatic protocol</a> for analysis of RNA-Seq data using our tools 
	    has been published at <em>Nature Protocols</em>.  The protocol covers read alignment with TopHat, 
	    gene and transcript discovery with Cufflinks, annotation analysis with Cuffmerge and Cuffcompare, 
	    differential expression analysis with Cuffdiff, and visualization with CummeRbund.  
	    Several variants of the protocol are included for those who wish to forgo certain analysis steps, such as gene discovery.
	  </p>
	  <br>

	  <h2>TopHat 1.4.1 release 2/2/2012</h2>
	  <p> Version 1.4.1 is a maintenance release addressing some issues found in the 1.4.0 release:
	</p><ul>
	  <li> fixed a bug that prevented the correct functionality of the new transcriptome mapping option for paired reads in cases where 
	  the user only wanted to map to the transcriptome (-T option) or there were no unmapped reads</li>
	  <li> fixed the -N/--initial-read-mismatches option to support values 
larger than 3 (e.g. for mapping on a genome from a different species). </li>
	  <li> added basic file checks for extreme cases when there are no initially unmapped reads</li>
	</ul>
	  <br>

      <h2>TopHat 1.4.0 release 1/5/2012</h2>
      <p> Version 1.4.0 includes the following new features and fixes:
	</p><ul>
	  <li> when a set of known transcripts is provided (-G/--GTF option) 
Tophat now takes the approach of mapping the reads on the 
	      transcriptome first, with only the unmapped reads being further 
aligned to the whole genome and going through the novel junction 
	      discovery process like before. This new approach was implemented 
by <a href="http://cs.berkeley.edu/%7Epimentel">Harold Pimentel</a>.</li>
	  <li> new command line options have been added for the new mapping-to-transcriptome approach; please check
	       <a href="manual.html#transcriptome">their documentation</a> which includes important notes about the 
	       new <a href="manual.html#t_idx"><tt>--transcriptome-index</tt></a> option for efficient use of this approach</li>
	  <li> the unmapped reads are now reported in the output directory as <tt>unmapped_left.fq.z</tt> (and <tt>unmapped_right.fq.z</tt> for paired reads)
	  </li><li> the --initial-read-mismatches value now also applies to final alignments resulted from joining segment mappings </li>
	  <li> we adjusted the selection of hits to be reported in case of multi-mapped segments, reads and read pairs </li>
	  <li> enhancements in junction discovery for the segment-search method in the case of paired-end reads </li>
	  <li> the reported running time now includes days
	  </li><li> fixed the non-deterministic behavior that could cause some differences in the output of repeated Tophat runs </li>
	  <li> fixed a regression bug that prevented the use of SOLiD reads with certain length of quality values </li>
	</ul>
      <br>

      <h2>TopHat 1.3.3 release 10/16/2011</h2>
      <p> Version 1.3.3 is primarily a bug-fix release:
	</p><ul>
	  <li> fixed a bug that prevented <i>coverage search</i> from being activated on 
	       short reads (with fewer than 3 segments, e.g. reads shorter than 75)
	  </li><li> fixed a samtools path inconsistency that in some system configurations caused tophat to 
	       exit with an error in the final stage, when sorting the "accepted_hits.bam" file
	  </li><li> for SOLiD reads, quality value strings should now be accepted with or without a primer value
	</li></ul>
      <br>

      <h2>TopHat 1.3.2 release 9/5/2011</h2>
      <p> Version 1.3.2 includes the following fixes and improvements:
	</p><ul>
	  <li> Deprecated -r as a required parameter (defaults to 50)
	  </li><li> Tophat no longer requires named pipes (<i>mkfifo</i>) to work, which were used in the previous version 
           to compress some of the temporary files, but was not supported on some file/systems;
           for systems supporting <i>mkfifo</i> the new -X option can be used to re-enable this functionality
	  </li><li> coverage-search is now working for a short read (e.g., &lt;40-bp) where a read is split into only one segment.
	</li></ul>
      <br>

	  <h2>iGenomes index and annotation packages available for download - 7/31/2011</h2>
	  <p> Illumina has generously provided a set of freely downloadable 
packages that contain everything you need to get started working with 
TopHat and Cufflinks.  
            These packages contain Bowtie indexes for the human, mouse, 
and fly genomes as well as many others.  
          The packages also contain annotation files (in GTF format) 
from UCSC, Ensembl, NCBI, and other sources.  
          These files are augmented with the special attributes 
Cufflinks needs to perform differential splicing and promoter analysis. 
 
          We strongly encourage users to download and try these 
packages!

		  <br>
      <h2>TopHat 1.3.1 release 6/23/2011</h2>
      <p> Version 1.3.1 includes the following bug fixes and changes.
	</p><ul>
	  <li> Quality value strings beginning or ending with "*" are no longer
	    truncated to a single quality value "*" in accepted_hits.bam
	  </li><li> SOLiD reads that have "!" (or 0) as the first quality value caused a
	    runtime error, which is now fixed
	  </li><li> --closure-search is compatible with internal file compression
	  </li><li> --max-deletion-length option is correctly handled
	  </li><li> A new option --initial-read-mismatch option is introduced that users
	    specify the number of mismatches allowed in the initial read mapping
	  </li><li> For short reads (usually &lt;45-bp), it is recommended that users
	    decrease segment length (--segment-length) to about half the read length
	    and segment mismatches (--segment-mismatches) to 0 or 1
	  </li><li> TLEN field in SAM format is correctly output
	  </li><li> Indel search has been turned on (by default) since TopHat 1.3.0 - users can
	    disable the functionality using --no-novel-indels
	</li></ul>
      <br>
		<h2>TopHat 1.3.0  release 6/2/2011</h2>
		<p><strong>Note (10:30 EST):</strong> the binary packages for 1.3.0 have been updated to correct a hardcoded python path.
		</p><p>This release includes some very substantial performance improvements, bug fixes, and enhancements.
			</p><ul>
			<li>Geo Pertea has restructured the internal workflow of TopHat so 
				that nearly all temporary data is compressed during a run.
				This greatly reduces the on-disk footprint of TopHat runs, and 
				also reduces the amount of disk I/O.  These enhancements
				should improve running time on networked filesystems.
			</li><li>Thanks to contributions from the <a href="http://picard.sourceforge.net/">Picard</a> team (notably Alec Wysoker at the Broad Institute),
				TopHat has some needed SAM compliance fixes and some additional
				command line options that make it easier to incorporate TopHat
				into sequencing core workflows and automated processing pipelines.
			</li><li>TopHat can optionally use Bowtie's <tt>-n</tt> flag as an alternative
				to the read mapping protocol.  The default is still to use <tt>-v</tt>,
				which can result in better spliced alignment accuracy when reads
				contain relatively few sequencing errors (particularly at the 3' end)
			</li><li>TopHat now supports both <a href="http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/gff.html">GTF2 and GFF3</a>
			</li><li>TopHat can take gzip or bzip2 compressed FASTQ or FASTA files as input,
			    decompressing them on the fly (the decompression program is determined based on the file name suffix)
			</li><li>The initial read inspection stage, used to determine the format, read length
				and other parameters needed for the run, is now significantly faster.
			</li><li>A bug in the installer caused the tophat script to be duplicated 
				(apparently without causing further problems).  Thanks to John
				Marshall for the fix to this and several other issues.
			</li><li>Numerous other minor bug fixes
			</li></ul>

      <h2>TopHat-Fusion 0.1.0 (Beta) release 5/09/2011</h2>
      <p>
	<a href="http://tophat-fusion.sourceforge.net">TopHat-Fusion</a> is released, mainly developed by
	Daehwan Kim and Steven Salzberg. TopHat-Fusion is an enhanced version of
	TopHat with the ability to align reads across fusion points, which

		<h2>TopHat 1.2.0  release 1/18/2011</h2>
	    <p>Version 1.2.0 includes some important bug fixes as well as a 
major new feature.  Thanks to the efforts of Ryan Kelley from Illumina, 
TopHat now supports detection of insertions and deletions using RNA-Seq 
data.  TopHat will report reads aligned across discovered indels by 
taking advantage of <tt>I</tt> and <tt>D</tt> CIGAR operators as 
specified by the SAM format.  For convenience, the indels discovered 
during each run are also reported in BED files, similar to the 
junctions.bed file that TopHat reports for splice junctions.
		</p><p>Version 1.2.0 also addresses the following issues:
			</p><ul>
				<li>A problem with alignment of reads of mixed length has been 
fixed.  Users with a wide range of read lengths, such as trimmed 454 
data sets, are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</li>
				<li>A compatibility issue with samtools version 0.1.12a has been fixed.</li>
				<li>Runtime validation of input files (e.g. raw junctions files) has been improved.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>TopHat 1.1.4  release 11/16/2010</h2>
	    <p>Version 1.1.4 includes three important bug fixes:
			</p><ul>
				<li>Another issue related to strand assignment in strand specific libraries has been fixed</li>
				<li>A limitation in aligning long reads has been overcome, substantially improving overall alignment sensitivity</li>
				<li>The <tt>--gtf-annotations</tt> was throwing an error during <tt>prep_reads</tt> due to a bug in internal command line parsing.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p>Several users pointed out that the recently released version 1.1.3 
had "1.1.0" listed in the version number on running TopHat.  This has 
been corrected in the 1.1.4 build. 
		</p><br>
		<h2>TopHat 1.1.3  release 11/13/2010</h2>
	    <p>This is a strongly recommend fix release of TopHat.  Version 
1.1.2 suffered from a bug related to the addition of strand specific 
read processing that could result in some reads being incorrectly 
assigned to the wrong strand.  This bug affected users of unstranded 
RNA-Seq data as well as users of stranded reads, so 1.1.3 is a 
recommended update for all users.
		</p><br>
		<h2>TopHat 1.1.2  release 10/26/2010</h2>
	    <p>This release of TopHat adds support for <b>strand-specific RNA-Seq alignment</b> for reads produced by a number of strand-specific protocols.  Please see the manual for details.  This release also supports <b>variable-length reads</b>. Version 1.1.2 also fixes several bugs  
		</p><ul>
			<li>A sorting issue for pairs that align in multiple places has been fixed.</li>
			<li>Some portability issues, which resulted in segfaults on some systems, have been fixed in the precompiled binaries.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>
		<h2>TopHat 1.1.1  release 10/11/2010</h2>
	    <p>This release of TopHat includes some fixes related to Colorspace read mapping.
		</p><ul>
			<li>Negative quality values are now handled correctly.</li>
			<li>Comments at the beginning of csfasta files no longer trigger an error.</li>
			<li><tt>--integer-quals</tt> no longer conflicts with <tt>-i</tt></li>
			<li>The header in TopHat BAM files now correctly lists the sort order as <tt>coordinate</tt>, with group order <tt>reference</tt></li>
		</ul>
		
		<br>
		<h2>Update - TopHat 1.1.0 packages</h2>
	    <p>The build of 1.1.0 released yesterday was throwing an exception 
with single end reads.  This has been corrected and the packages have 
been updated.  
		</p><br>
		<h2>New developers - Daehwan Kim and Geo Pertea</h2>
		<p>The TopHat team has been joined by Daehwan Kim and Geo Pertea. 
Daehwan is a Ph.D. student at the Center for Bioinformatics and 
Computational Biology (CBCB), working with Steven Salzberg.  He is 
principally responsible for extending TopHat to support SOLiD sequencing
 reads.  Geo is an informatics engineer at CBCB, and has made numerous 
contributions to <a href="http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/">Cufflinks</a> along with a number of other tools built at CBCB.</p>
			<br>
		<h2>TopHat 1.1.0  release 10/03/2010</h2>
	    <p>This release of TopHat includes some major enhancements:
		</p><ul>
			<li>TopHat now supports Colorspace reads from Life Technologies' 
SOLiD sequencer, thanks to the efforts of Daehwan Kim and Geo Pertea.  
Note that you will need to <a href="ftp://ftp.cbcb.umd.edu/pub/data/bowtie_indexes/">download</a>
 a Colorspace Bowtie index to use TopHat with SOLiD reads.  Colorspace 
Bowtie indices typically have "_c" in their name to distinguish them 
from nucleotide space indices.</li>
			<li>Alignments are now reported in BAM instead of SAM.  This requires installation of the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net">SAM tools</a>.</li>
			<li>GFF3 support has been dropped in favor of GTF.  If you are 
working with an organism that is well annotated, we recommend supplying a
 GTF from <a href="http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html">Ensembl</a> or <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start">UCSC</a> to maximize spliced alignment sensitivity.  TopHat will augment the annotated junctions with those it finds during each run. </li>
			<li>TopHat no longer outputs the wigglegram after each run, as browsers such as <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/">IGV</a>, <a href="http://www.bioviz.org/igb/">IGB</a> and <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC</a> can display BAM files directly.</li>
		</ul>  
		<br>
		<h2>TopHat 1.0.14 (BETA) release 6/30/2010</h2>
	    <p>This fix release includes a new FASTQ parser (written by Geo Pertea) and generally improves error checking and reliability.  
		</p><br>
	
		<h2>TopHat 1.0.13 (BETA) release 2/5/2010</h2>
	    <p>This is a fix release that addresses several bugs.  Notably:
	    </p><ul>
			<li>SAM quality strings are now reported on the Phred scale, regardless
				of whether the input reads were in Phred or Solexa scaling, as require
				by the SAM spec.  The conversion code in <tt>qual.h/.cpp</tt> was written
				by Ben Langmead and is borrowed from Bowtie.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		  <h2>Bowtie index update 11/14/2009</h2>
			<p>In response to user requests, <a href="http://faculty.jhsph.edu/default.cfm?faculty_id=2209&amp;grouped=false&amp;searchText=&amp;department_id=3&amp;departmentName=Biostatistics">Ben Langmead</a>
		 		was kind enough to rebuild the Bowtie indexes for human and mouse
		 		from UCSC assembly fasta files.  Because UCSC fasta files have 
				simple record names, such as "chrX", TopHat runs against them
				are easier to visualize with the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">
				UCSC genome browser</a> or the <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/">
				Integrative Genomics Viewer</a>.  We recommend that users who need
				indexes other than human or mouse build them from UCSC fasta files.
			</p><br>
		 	<h2>TopHat 1.0.12 (BETA) release 10/28/2009</h2>
		    <p>This release includes both critical fixes and new features, including:
		    </p><ul>
			<li>A serious bug that hurts sensitivity for short (~36bp) reads 
				that was introduced in 1.0.11 has been fixed</li>
				
			<li>TopHat now automatically <strong>deletes</strong> the 
				intermediate files it produces during each run, which can be 
				very large.  You can preserve them by specifying <tt>--keep-tmp</tt> 
				at the beginning of a run.</li>
				
			<li>A new optional search algorithm for short (~36bp) reads, 
				designed to improve junction detection sensitivity, is now available with
				<tt>--butterfly-search</tt>.</li>
				
			<li>TopHat <strong>no longer calculates gene expression</strong>. 
				Users interested in expression calculations should consider using 
				<a href="http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu">Cufflinks</a> for gene- 
				and isoform-level expression calculations.</li>
				
			<li>Numerous performance enhancements and reductions in memory usage.  
				For reads 75bp or longer, memory usage is dramatically lower, 
				and should scale much for runs with hundreds of millions of reads.</li>
			<li>The <a href="manual.html">manual</a> has been updated to better 
				describe the types of reads TopHat expects.  The manual also 
				incorrectly stated that TopHat doesn't look for "GC-AG" and 
				"AT-AC" introns, and this has been corrected.</li>
			</ul>
		 <br>
		 <h2>IMPORTANT - Bowtie update 10/13/2009</h2>
		    <p>Until recently, there was a bug that could cause TopHat to report
	        no alignments or junctions with some Bowtie indexes (including) some
	        indexes downloadable from this site.  All users are strongly 
	        encouraged to upgrade to Bowtie 0.11.0 or later, and the next 
	        update to TopHat will force this upgrade.</p><p><br>
		 </p><h2>TopHat 1.0.11 (BETA) and Cufflinks release 9/26/2009</h2>
		    <p> We're pleased to announce the release of a sister tool to TopHat, 
			called <a href="http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu">Cufflinks</a>.  
			TopHat aligns your RNA-Seq reads; Cufflinks assembles those 
			alignments into transcripts and also calculates isoform and 
			gene level expression in your samples. 
			
			</p><p>This TopHat release contains a 
			number of stability improvements, fixes, and some substantial 
			performance increases.  The disk footprint is also reduced, though
			it's still large, and further reductions are coming in future 
			releases.
			
			</p><p>We advise all users to adopt Cufflinks to compute expression values.
			 Cufflinks contains a sophisticated algorithm for this calculation, 
			 that is far more accurate than TopHat's method.  In an upcoming release
			 of TopHat, the RPKM calculation in TopHat will be <strong>removed</strong> to simplify maintenance.
		 </p><br>
		 <h2>1.0.10 (BETA) release 7/30/2009</h2>
		 <p> This is a fix release.  Notable changes:
			</p><ul>
			<li>More SAM compliance fixes.</li>
			<li>Reduced the frequency of certain types of false junctions through improved spliced alignment filtering</li>
			</ul>
		  
		<br>
		 <h2>Minor update to 1.0.9 7/10/2009</h2>
		 <p> Version 1.0.9 of TopHat released on 7/8/09 had an incorrect default 
			 value for --max-intron length.  It is now 500,000, as intended.</p><p><br>
		 </p><h2>1.0.9 (BETA) release - 7/8/2009</h2>
		 <p>This release includes both fixes and new features.  This upgrade 
			<strong>requires</strong> Bowtie 0.10.0.0 or later.  Other changes including:
		    </p><ul>
			<li>Substantially improved sensitivity for reads shorter than 75bp</li>
			<li>An optional "gap-filling" phase to map multireads from transcribed repeats</li>
			<li>Fixed some SAM compliance issues</li>
			<li>Optional (limited) search for alignments that involve microexons</li>
			<li>Complex index record names no longer crash the pipeline.</li>
			<li>The command line options have been overhauled, and the meaning
				of the <tt>-a/--min-anchor</tt> option has changed.  Please
				see the <a href="manual.html">manual</a> for further details.</li>
			<li>Closure search is now off by default for all read types</li>
			<li>Coverage search is off by default for reads 75bp or longer</li>
			<li>Previous version could report spliced alignments with gaps longer than
				<tt>--max-intron</tt>, if any were found.  The <tt>--max-intron</tt> and 
			    <tt>--min-intron</tt> limits are now strictly enforced.
			</li></ul>
		<br>
		<h2> Bowtie updated to 0.10.0.0 </h2>
			<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: TopHat 1.0.8 is incompatible with 
				Bowtie 0.10.0.0, which was released this week.  While the release of 
				TopHat 1.0.9, which is imminent, will fix the incompatibilities,
				users are encouraged to stick with Bowtie 0.9.9.3 for now.</p>
				<br>
		<h2>1.0.8 (BETA) release - 5/25/2009</h2>
		 <p> This is mostly a fix release, but all users are encourage to upgrade, 
			as some of the bugs fixed were fairly major. Other notable improvements include:
		    </p><ul>
			<li>If you have reads 50bp or longer, TopHat will look for <tt>GC-AG</tt> and <tt>AT-AC</tt> introns </li>
			<li>Logging has been improved</li>
			<li>Fewer false positives in gene families with tandem copies</li>
			</ul>
		 <p> <strong>Known issues:</strong>
			</p><ul>
				<li> Some users have reported pipeline crashes when using Bowtie 
indexes with long or complex record names.  This will be fixed in the 
next release, but for now, using an index with simple names (no spaces 
or pipes) is a workaround.  Users are recommended to use names like 
"chr12" to avoid problems. 
			</li></ul>
			
		<br>
		<h2>1.0 (BETA) release - 5/4/2009</h2>
		 <p> TopHat has been almost entirely redesigned and rewritten to handle
			"second-generation" RNA-Seq data. Reads longer than 50bp and paired
			end reads are substantially more powerful for finding splice 
			junctions, and TopHat needed new algorithms to take advantage of them.
			While this release should be considered a beta, and still contains bugs,
			it has been under development for several months and has been 
			tested by several groups on both first- and second-generation RNA-Seq
			data in multiple organisms.  Longer and/or paired end reads provide
			a dramatic leap in sensitivity and specificity. Notable improvements include:
		 </p><ul>
			<li>Paired-end RNA-Seq read support</li>
			<li>Long read support</li>
			<li>Improved SAM output</li>
			<li>No longer depends on Maq</li>
			<li>Mismatches near splicing anchors now allowed</li>
			<li>Much more of the pipeline is multithreaded, yielding a massive performance boost</li>
			<li>Compiles under GCC 4.3</li>
			</ul>
			
		<br>

			paper</a> on discovering splice junctions has appeared at 
			<a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/">Bioinformatics</a>. 
		</p>	
		<br>
		<h2>0.8.3 release - 3/12/2009</h2>
		 <p> This release contains the following enhancements and fixes:
		 </p><ul>
			<li>Reporting now has a smaller memory footprint</li>
			<li>A possible source of erroneous alignments due to hashing collisions has been eliminated</li>
			<li>The install scripts now correctly detects whether to build TopHat with 64-bit compiler flags.</li>
			</ul>
			
		<br>
		<h2>TopHat paper accepted - 3/1/2009</h2>
		 <p> Our paper on discovering splice junctions has been accepted at 
			<a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/">Bioinformatics</a>, 
			and should appear soon.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h2>0.8.2 release - 3/1/2009</h2>
		 <p> This release contains the following enhancements and fixes:
		 </p><ul>
			<li>TopHat now reports the alignments it finds in the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net%0A%09%09%09%09">SAM format</a>.  The SAM tools were written primarily by 
				Heng Li at Sanger, and will allow TopHat users to call 
				expressed SNPs from their RNA-Seq reads.  The SAM tools 
				themselves are still under development, so TopHat's SAM 
				support should be considered experimental.</li>
			<li>You can now specify a list of junctions for TopHat to check
				in a raw format, without using a GFF file of genes</li>
			<li>The new <tt>-o</tt> option allows you to change where TopHat
				puts its output, instead of always writing to "./tophat_out"</li>
			</ul>
			
		<br>
		<h2>0.8.1 release - 1/30/2009</h2>
		 <p> This release contains the following enhancements and fixes:
		 </p><ul>
			<li>New experimental support for user-supplied annotations. 
				TopHat will accept a GFF file, and will look for junctions 
				contained in the GFF file.  TopHat will also perform a basic 
				RPKM calculation on the regions in the annotation, normalized 
				to those annotations only (rather than the whole map).  The 
				file must contain "gene", "exon" and "mRNA" records, in the 
				normal record ID, Parent heirarchy.  Users are encouraged to 
				treat GFF support as unstable and interpret their results with
				caution.</li>
			<li>Several minor bugfixes.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p> TopHat 0.8.1 uses some code kindly provided by <a href="http://math.berkeley.edu/%7Erbradley/">Robert Bradley</a>. The
        code originally came from Rob's statistical alignment package <a href="http://fsa.sourceforge.net/">FSA</a>. </p>
			
		
		<br>
		<h2>0.8.0 release - 1/19/2009</h2>
		 <p> This release contains the following enhancements and fixes:
		 </p><ul>
			<li>Dramatic reduction in false positives.</li>
			<li>TopHat now estimates a minor isoform frequency for each splice
				junction, and filters infrequent events to cut down dramatically
				on the false positives. By default, minor isoforms must occur
				at at least 15 percent of the major isoform.</li>
			<li>The new output file coverage.wig is a UCSC wigglegram of alignment
				coverage.</li>
			<li>TopHat supports multithreading, though not all stages of the 
				pipeline use multiple threads.</li>
			<li>TopHat now allows reads to have multiple alignments, and it
				suppresses alignments for reads that have more than a user-specified
				number (10, by default).</li>
			<li>The memory exhaustion problem associated with converting 
				Bowtie alignments to Maq has been fixed.</li>
			<li>You are no longer required to concatenate your reads into a 
				single input file.</li>
			<li>TopHat will attempt to automatically determine seed length,
				quality scale, and FASTA/FASTQ format from your input reads.</li>
			<li>If you are missing a Maq binary fasta file for your reference,
				one will be created in the output directory 
				using <tt>bowtie-inspect</tt>.  You can copy this file to the
				location of your bowtie index to avoid this step in your next 
				run.</li>
			</ul>
		
			
		
		<br>
		<h2>0.7.2 release - 12/05/2008</h2>
		 <p> The following issues have been fixed:
		 </p><ul>
			<li>Bowtie 0.9.8 renamed <tt>bowtie-convert</tt> to 
				<tt>bowtie-maqconvert</tt>, and TopHat is now compatible with 
				both the new and old name.</li>
			<li>Minor cosmetic improvements in the TopHat output log.</li>
			<li>Improved checking in the installer to emit sensible error 
				messages when compiling on Solaris.  Solaris is currently not
				supported, but hopefully will be in the next release.</li>
			</ul>
		
		<p> Known issues:
		</p><ul>
			<li>TopHat can exhaust memory when run with many (&gt; 50 million) 
				reads on some machines.  This will be fixed in the next release. </li>
		</ul>	
		
		<br>
	  <h2>0.7.1 release - 11/08/2008</h2>
	  <p> The following issues have been fixed:
		</p><ul>
			<li>Maq 0.7.0 changed the Maq map file format.  Bowtie 0.9.7 now 
				supports both the new and old mapping format, and thus so now
				does TopHat.  
				TopHat now checks the version of Maq on the system and uses the
				correct format. </li>
			<li>Minor command line interface improvements</li>
			<li>The <tt>-X</tt> option has been added to allow the use of FASTQ
				files that are scaled on the Solexa quality scale, as opposed
				to Phred (the default).  Note that TopHat doesn't support FASTQ-int,
				only ASCII-encoded qualities are used.
			</li><li>The <tt>-D</tt> option has been added, allowing users to 
				specify when to look for junctions within single islands, as 
				opposed to just between two distinct islands</li>
			<li>The <tt>-Q</tt> option allows the user to specify a Phred quality character
				below which the island consensus caller will use the reference 
				base call.  That is, TopHat will not allow SNPs to be called
				where base quality drops below a certain threshold.
			</li><li>TopHat now includes Heng Li's <tt>fq_all2std.pl</tt> format
				conversion script to make installation easier.</li>
		</ul>
	  <br>
	
      <h2>0.7.0 release - 10/27/08</h2>
      
      <p> The first public release of TopHat is now available for download.
      To use TopHat, you will need to install <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net">Bowtie</a> and <a href="http://maq.sourceforge.net">Maq</a>. Both are open source and
      freely available under the Artistic license.
      When you install Bowtie, you should also install the Bowtie index for
      the genome in your RNA-Seq experiment, if one is available. If there is
      no pre-built index for the organism you're interested in, you can follow
      the Bowtie manual's section on <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.html#indx">how to build one yourself</a>. </p>
      
	  <p> Because this is the first release, the manual is very limited. Only the
		basic options have been described. However, we will be updating it frequently,
		so please check back. If you find something unclear, or have questions about
		how TopHat works, please email <a href="mailto:cole@cs.umd.edu">Cole
		Trapnell</a>.  We will be posting a list of frequently asked questions soon.  
	
		</p><p> In this release, TopHat <strong>does not consider mate pairing</strong>
			between reads. You can analyze paired-end RNA-Seq data with TopHat, but the
			program won't make use of the mate information. Yet. Use of mate pair
			information is our <strong>top development priority</strong>.  
			Check back soon for a release with full paired-end support
