      <h2>TopHat 1.3.3 release 10/16/2011</h2>
      <p> Version 1.3.3 is primarily a bug-fix release:
	<ul>
	  <li> fixed a bug that prevented <i>coverage search</i> from being activated on 
	       short reads (with fewer than 3 segments, e.g. reads shorter than 75)
	  <li> fixed a samtools path inconsistency that in some system configurations caused tophat to 
	       exit with an error in the final stage, when sorting the "accepted_hits.bam" file
	  <li> for SOLiD reads, quality value strings should now be accepted with or without a primer value
	</ul>
      </p><br/>

      <h2>TopHat 1.3.2 release 9/5/2011</h2>
      <p> Version 1.3.2 includes the following fixes and improvements:
	<ul>
	  <li> Deprecated -r as a required parameter (defaults to 50)
	  <li> Tophat no longer requires named pipes (<i>mkfifo</i>) to work, which were used in the previous version 
           to compress some of the temporary files, but was not supported on some file/systems;
           for systems supporting <i>mkfifo</i> the new -X option can be used to re-enable this functionality
	  <li> coverage-search is now working for a short read (e.g., &lt;40-bp) where a read is split into only one segment.
	</ul>
      </p><br/>

	  <h2>iGenomes index and annotation packages available for download - 7/31/2011</h2>
	  <p> Illumina has generously provided a set of freely downloadable packages that contain everything you need to get started working with TopHat and Cufflinks.  
            These packages contain Bowtie indexes for the human, mouse, and fly genomes as well as many others.  
          The packages also contain annotation files (in GTF format) from UCSC, Ensembl, NCBI, and other sources.  
          These files are augmented with the special attributes Cufflinks needs to perform differential splicing and promoter analysis.  
          We strongly encourage users to download and try these packages!
		  <p></p>
		  <br>
      <h2>TopHat 1.3.1 release 6/23/2011</h2>
      <p> Version 1.3.1 includes the following bug fixes and changes.
	<ul>
	  <li> Quality value strings beginning or ending with "*" are no longer
	    truncated to a single quality value "*" in accepted_hits.bam
	  <li> SOLiD reads that have "!" (or 0) as the first quality value caused a
	    runtime error, which is now fixed
	  <li> --closure-search is compatible with internal file compression
	  <li> --max-deletion-length option is correctly handled
	  <li> A new option --initial-read-mismatch option is introduced that users
	    specify the number of mismatches allowed in the initial read mapping
	  <li> For short reads (usually &lt;45-bp), it is recommended that users
	    decrease segment length (--segment-length) to about half the read length
	    and segment mismatches (--segment-mismatches) to 0 or 1
	  <li> TLEN field in SAM format is correctly output
	  <li> Indel search has been turned on (by default) since TopHat 1.3.0 - users can
	    disable the functionality using --no-novel-indels
	</ul>
      </p><br/>
		<h2>TopHat 1.3.0  release 6/2/2011</h2>
		<p><strong>Note (10:30 EST):</strong> the binary packages for 1.3.0 have been updated to correct a hardcoded python path.
		<p>This release includes some very substantial performance improvements, bug fixes, and enhancements.
			<ul>
			<li>Geo Pertea has restructured the internal workflow of TopHat so 
				that nearly all temporary data is compressed during a run.
				This greatly reduces the on-disk footprint of TopHat runs, and 
				also reduces the amount of disk I/O.  These enhancements
				should improve running time on networked filesystems.
			<li>Thanks to contributions from the <a href="http://picard.sourceforge.net/">Picard</a> team (notably Alec Wysoker at the Broad Institute),
				TopHat has some needed SAM compliance fixes and some additional
				command line options that make it easier to incorporate TopHat
				into sequencing core workflows and automated processing pipelines.
			<li>TopHat can optionally use Bowtie's <tt>-n</tt> flag as an alternative
				to the read mapping protocol.  The default is still to use <tt>-v</tt>,
				which can result in better spliced alignment accuracy when reads
				contain relatively few sequencing errors (particularly at the 3' end)
			<li>TopHat now supports both <a href="http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/gff.html">GTF2 and GFF3</a>
			<li>TopHat can take gzip or bzip2 compressed FASTQ or FASTA files as input,
			    decompressing them on the fly (the decompression program is determined based on the file name suffix)
			<li>The initial read inspection stage, used to determine the format, read length
				and other parameters needed for the run, is now significantly faster.
			<li>A bug in the installer caused the tophat script to be duplicated 
				(apparently without causing further problems).  Thanks to John
				Marshall for the fix to this and several other issues.
			<li>Numerous other minor bug fixes
			</ul>
	    </p><br/>
      <h2>TopHat-Fusion 0.1.0 (Beta) release 5/09/2011</h2>
      <p>
	<a href="http://tophat-fusion.sourceforge.net">TopHat-Fusion</a> is released, mainly developed by
	Daehwan Kim and Steven Salzberg. TopHat-Fusion is an enhanced version of
	TopHat with the ability to align reads across fusion points, which
	results from the breakage and re-joining of two different chromosomes,
	or from rearrangements within a chromosome. For more information, please visit <a href="http://tophat-fusion.sourceforge.net">the TopHat-Fusion website</a>.
      </p><br/>
      <h2>New "Getting Help" email address for TopHat and Cufflinks</h2>
	    <p>In order to more effectively answer user help requests and improve usability and documentation, we have created an email address to which users can send messages for technical support.  If you have questions about Cufflinks or TopHat, please send them to <a href="mailto:tophat.cufflinks@gmail.com">tophat.cufflinks@gmail.com</a>.  We will do our best to answer your question in a timely fashion, although <b>please read the manual carefully</b> before sending your email.  We have very limited time to answer questions, and most questions require careful, technical answers.  
		
		<p>If you believe you have found a bug in the software, please <b>include a small package of test data</b> with your email so that we can reproduce your problem locally.  A test example makes it much easier to correct the issue.
		</p><br/>
		<h2>TopHat 1.2.0  release 1/18/2011</h2>
	    <p>Version 1.2.0 includes some important bug fixes as well as a major new feature.  Thanks to the efforts of Ryan Kelley from Illumina, TopHat now supports detection of insertions and deletions using RNA-Seq data.  TopHat will report reads aligned across discovered indels by taking advantage of <tt>I</tt> and <tt>D</tt> CIGAR operators as specified by the SAM format.  For convenience, the indels discovered during each run are also reported in BED files, similar to the junctions.bed file that TopHat reports for splice junctions.
		<p>Version 1.2.0 also addresses the following issues:
			<ul>
				<li>A problem with alignment of reads of mixed length has been fixed.  Users with a wide range of read lengths, such as trimmed 454 data sets, are strongly encouraged to upgrade.</li>
				<li>A compatibility issue with samtools version 0.1.12a has been fixed.</li>
				<li>Runtime validation of input files (e.g. raw junctions files) has been improved.</li>
			</ul>
		</p><br/>
		<h2>TopHat and Cufflinks now supported through Galaxy</h2>
	    <p>We are very pleased to announce that you can now run TopHat and Cufflinks through <a href="http://usegalaxy.org">Galaxy</a>.  The Galaxy project aims to make informatics tools accessible through the web, and allows you to experiment with parameter settings and create sophisticated analysis workflows easily. Galaxy is developed by researchers at Emory University and Penn State in the <a href="http://bx.mathcs.emory.edu/">Taylor</a> and <a href="http://www.bx.psu.edu/~anton/">Nekrutenko</a> labs, respectively.  We are extremely grateful for the Galaxy team's work, and proud to have TopHat and Cufflinks offered through their platform.
		</p><br/>
		
		<h2>TopHat 1.1.4  release 11/16/2010</h2>
	    <p>Version 1.1.4 includes three important bug fixes:
			<ul>
				<li>Another issue related to strand assignment in strand specific libraries has been fixed</li>
				<li>A limitation in aligning long reads has been overcome, substantially improving overall alignment sensitivity</li>
				<li>The <tt>--gtf-annotations</tt> was throwing an error during <tt>prep_reads</tt> due to a bug in internal command line parsing.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Several users pointed out that the recently released version 1.1.3 had "1.1.0" listed in the version number on running TopHat.  This has been corrected in the 1.1.4 build. 
		</p><br/>
		<h2>TopHat 1.1.3  release 11/13/2010</h2>
	    <p>This is a strongly recommend fix release of TopHat.  Version 1.1.2 suffered from a bug related to the addition of strand specific read processing that could result in some reads being incorrectly assigned to the wrong strand.  This bug affected users of unstranded RNA-Seq data as well as users of stranded reads, so 1.1.3 is a recommended update for all users.
		</p><br/>
		<h2>TopHat 1.1.2  release 10/26/2010</h2>
	    <p>This release of TopHat adds support for <b>strand-specific RNA-Seq alignment</b> for reads produced by a number of strand-specific protocols.  Please see the manual for details.  This release also supports <b>variable-length reads</b>. Version 1.1.2 also fixes several bugs  
		<ul>
			<li>A sorting issue for pairs that align in multiple places has been fixed.</li>
			<li>Some portability issues, which resulted in segfaults on some systems, have been fixed in the precompiled binaries.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>TopHat 1.1.1  release 10/11/2010</h2>
	    <p>This release of TopHat includes some fixes related to Colorspace read mapping.
		<ul>
			<li>Negative quality values are now handled correctly.</li>
			<li>Comments at the beginning of csfasta files no longer trigger an error.</li>
			<li><tt>--integer-quals</tt> no longer conflicts with <tt>-i</tt></li>
			<li>The header in TopHat BAM files now correctly lists the sort order as <tt>coordinate</tt>, with group order <tt>reference</tt></li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>Update - TopHat 1.1.0 packages</h2>
	    <p>The build of 1.1.0 released yesterday was throwing an exception with single end reads.  This has been corrected and the packages have been updated.  
		</p><br/>
		<h2>New developers - Daehwan Kim and Geo Pertea</h2>
		<p>The TopHat team has been joined by Daehwan Kim and Geo Pertea. Daehwan is a Ph.D. student at the Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CBCB), working with Steven Salzberg.  He is principally responsible for extending TopHat to support SOLiD sequencing reads.  Geo is an informatics engineer at CBCB, and has made numerous contributions to <a href="http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/">Cufflinks</a> along with a number of other tools built at CBCB.</p>
			<br/>
		<h2>TopHat 1.1.0  release 10/03/2010</h2>
	    <p>This release of TopHat includes some major enhancements:
		<ul>
			<li>TopHat now supports Colorspace reads from Life Technologies' SOLiD sequencer, thanks to the efforts of Daehwan Kim and Geo Pertea.  Note that you will need to <a href="ftp://ftp.cbcb.umd.edu/pub/data/bowtie_indexes/">download</a> a Colorspace Bowtie index to use TopHat with SOLiD reads.  Colorspace Bowtie indices typically have "_c" in their name to distinguish them from nucleotide space indices.</li>
			<li>Alignments are now reported in BAM instead of SAM.  This requires installation of the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net">SAM tools</a>.</li>
			<li>GFF3 support has been dropped in favor of GTF.  If you are working with an organism that is well annotated, we recommend supplying a GTF from <a href="http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html">Ensembl</a> or <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables?command=start">UCSC</a> to maximize spliced alignment sensitivity.  TopHat will augment the annotated junctions with those it finds during each run. </li>
			<li>TopHat no longer outputs the wigglegram after each run, as browsers such as <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/">IGV</a>, <a href="http://www.bioviz.org/igb/">IGB</a> and <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">UCSC</a> can display BAM files directly.</li>
		</ul>  
		</p><br/>
		<h2>TopHat 1.0.14 (BETA) release 6/30/2010</h2>
	    <p>This fix release includes a new FASTQ parser (written by Geo Pertea) and generally improves error checking and reliability.  
		</p><br/>
	
		<h2>TopHat 1.0.13 (BETA) release 2/5/2010</h2>
	    <p>This is a fix release that addresses several bugs.  Notably:
	    <ul>
			<li>SAM quality strings are now reported on the Phred scale, regardless
				of whether the input reads were in Phred or Solexa scaling, as require
				by the SAM spec.  The conversion code in <tt>qual.h/.cpp</tt> was written
				by Ben Langmead and is borrowed from Bowtie.</li>
		</ul>
		</p><br/>
		  <h2>Bowtie index update 11/14/2009</h2>
			<p>In response to user requests, <a href="http://faculty.jhsph.edu/default.cfm?faculty_id=2209&grouped=false&searchText=&department_id=3&departmentName=Biostatistics">Ben Langmead</a>
		 		was kind enough to rebuild the Bowtie indexes for human and mouse
		 		from UCSC assembly fasta files.  Because UCSC fasta files have 
				simple record names, such as "chrX", TopHat runs against them
				are easier to visualize with the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/">
				UCSC genome browser</a> or the <a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/">
				Integrative Genomics Viewer</a>.  We recommend that users who need
				indexes other than human or mouse build them from UCSC fasta files.
			</p><br/>
		 	<h2>TopHat 1.0.12 (BETA) release 10/28/2009</h2>
		    <p>This release includes both critical fixes and new features, including:
		    <ul>
			<li>A serious bug that hurts sensitivity for short (~36bp) reads 
				that was introduced in 1.0.11 has been fixed</li>
				
			<li>TopHat now automatically <strong>deletes</strong> the 
				intermediate files it produces during each run, which can be 
				very large.  You can preserve them by specifying <tt>--keep-tmp</tt> 
				at the beginning of a run.</li>
				
			<li>A new optional search algorithm for short (~36bp) reads, 
				designed to improve junction detection sensitivity, is now available with
				<tt>--butterfly-search</tt>.</li>
				
			<li>TopHat <strong>no longer calculates gene expression</strong>. 
				Users interested in expression calculations should consider using 
				<a href="http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu">Cufflinks</a> for gene- 
				and isoform-level expression calculations.</li>
				
			<li>Numerous performance enhancements and reductions in memory usage.  
				For reads 75bp or longer, memory usage is dramatically lower, 
				and should scale much for runs with hundreds of millions of reads.</li>
			<li>The <a href="manual.html">manual</a> has been updated to better 
				describe the types of reads TopHat expects.  The manual also 
				incorrectly stated that TopHat doesn't look for "GC-AG" and 
				"AT-AC" introns, and this has been corrected.</li>
			</ul>
		 </p><br/>
		 <h2>IMPORTANT - Bowtie update 10/13/2009</h2>
		    <p>Until recently, there was a bug that could cause TopHat to report
	        no alignments or junctions with some Bowtie indexes (including) some
	        indexes downloadable from this site.  All users are strongly 
	        encouraged to upgrade to Bowtie 0.11.0 or later, and the next 
	        update to TopHat will force this upgrade.<p><br/>
		 <h2>TopHat 1.0.11 (BETA) and Cufflinks release 9/26/2009</h2>
		    <p> We're pleased to announce the release of a sister tool to TopHat, 
			called <a href="http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu">Cufflinks</a>.  
			TopHat aligns your RNA-Seq reads; Cufflinks assembles those 
			alignments into transcripts and also calculates isoform and 
			gene level expression in your samples. 
			
			<p>This TopHat release contains a 
			number of stability improvements, fixes, and some substantial 
			performance increases.  The disk footprint is also reduced, though
			it's still large, and further reductions are coming in future 
			releases.
			
			<p>We advise all users to adopt Cufflinks to compute expression values.
			 Cufflinks contains a sophisticated algorithm for this calculation, 
			 that is far more accurate than TopHat's method.  In an upcoming release
			 of TopHat, the RPKM calculation in TopHat will be <strong>removed</strong> to simplify maintenance.
		 </p><br/>
		 <h2>1.0.10 (BETA) release 7/30/2009</h2>
		 <p> This is a fix release.  Notable changes:
			<ul>
			<li>More SAM compliance fixes.</li>
			<li>Reduced the frequency of certain types of false junctions through improved spliced alignment filtering</li>
			</ul>
		 </p> 
		<br/>
		 <h2>Minor update to 1.0.9 7/10/2009</h2>
		 <p> Version 1.0.9 of TopHat released on 7/8/09 had an incorrect default 
			 value for --max-intron length.  It is now 500,000, as intended.<p><br/>
		 <h2>1.0.9 (BETA) release - 7/8/2009</h2>
		 <p>This release includes both fixes and new features.  This upgrade 
			<strong>requires</strong> Bowtie 0.10.0.0 or later.  Other changes including:
		    <ul>
			<li>Substantially improved sensitivity for reads shorter than 75bp</li>
			<li>An optional "gap-filling" phase to map multireads from transcribed repeats</li>
			<li>Fixed some SAM compliance issues</li>
			<li>Optional (limited) search for alignments that involve microexons</li>
			<li>Complex index record names no longer crash the pipeline.</li>
			<li>The command line options have been overhauled, and the meaning

			<li>Closure search is now off by default for all read types</li>
			<li>Coverage search is off by default for reads 75bp or longer</li>
			<li>Previous version could report spliced alignments with gaps longer than

		<h2> Bowtie updated to 0.10.0.0 </h2>
			<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: TopHat 1.0.8 is incompatible with 
				Bowtie 0.10.0.0, which was released this week.  While the release of 
				TopHat 1.0.9, which is imminent, will fix the incompatibilities,
				users are encouraged to stick with Bowtie 0.9.9.3 for now.</p>
				<br/>
		<h2>1.0.8 (BETA) release - 5/25/2009</h2>
		 <p> This is mostly a fix release, but all users are encourage to upgrade, 
			as some of the bugs fixed were fairly major. Other notable improvements include:
		    <ul>
			<li>If you have reads 50bp or longer, TopHat will look for <tt>GC-AG</tt> and <tt>AT-AC</tt> introns </li>
			<li>Logging has been improved</li>
			<li>Fewer false positives in gene families with tandem copies</li>
			</ul>
		 <p> <strong>Known issues:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li> Some users have reported pipeline crashes when using Bowtie indexes with long or complex record names.  This will be fixed in the next release, but for now, using an index with simple names (no spaces or pipes) is a workaround.  Users are recommended to use names like "chr12" to avoid problems. 
			</ul>
		</p>	
		<br/>
		<h2>1.0 (BETA) release - 5/4/2009</h2>
		 <p> TopHat has been almost entirely redesigned and rewritten to handle
			"second-generation" RNA-Seq data. Reads longer than 50bp and paired
			end reads are substantially more powerful for finding splice 
			junctions, and TopHat needed new algorithms to take advantage of them.
			While this release should be considered a beta, and still contains bugs,
			it has been under development for several months and has been 
			tested by several groups on both first- and second-generation RNA-Seq
			data in multiple organisms.  Longer and/or paired end reads provide
			a dramatic leap in sensitivity and specificity. Notable improvements include:
		 <ul>
			<li>Paired-end RNA-Seq read support</li>
			<li>Long read support</li>
			<li>Improved SAM output</li>
			<li>No longer depends on Maq</li>
			<li>Mismatches near splicing anchors now allowed</li>
			<li>Much more of the pipeline is multithreaded, yielding a massive performance boost</li>
			<li>Compiles under GCC 4.3</li>
			</ul>

			Our <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/btp120">
			paper</a> on discovering splice junctions has appeared at 
			<a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/">Bioinformatics</a>. 
		</p>	
		<br/>
		<h2>0.8.3 release - 3/12/2009</h2>
		 <p> This release contains the following enhancements and fixes:
		 <ul>
			<li>Reporting now has a smaller memory footprint</li>
			<li>A possible source of erroneous alignments due to hashing collisions has been eliminated</li>
			<li>The install scripts now correctly detects whether to build TopHat with 64-bit compiler flags.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>	
		<br/>
		<h2>TopHat paper accepted - 3/1/2009</h2>
		 <p> Our paper on discovering splice junctions has been accepted at 
			<a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/">Bioinformatics</a>, 
			and should appear soon.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>0.8.2 release - 3/1/2009</h2>
		 <p> This release contains the following enhancements and fixes:
		 <ul>
			<li>TopHat now reports the alignments it finds in the <a href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net
				">SAM format</a>.  The SAM tools were written primarily by 
				Heng Li at Sanger, and will allow TopHat users to call 
				expressed SNPs from their RNA-Seq reads.  The SAM tools 
				themselves are still under development, so TopHat's SAM 
				support should be considered experimental.</li>
			<li>You can now specify a list of junctions for TopHat to check
				in a raw format, without using a GFF file of genes</li>
			<li>The new <tt>-o</tt> option allows you to change where TopHat
				puts its output, instead of always writing to "./tophat_out"</li>
			</ul>
		</p>	
		<br/>
		<h2>0.8.1 release - 1/30/2009</h2>
		 <p> This release contains the following enhancements and fixes:
		 <ul>
			<li>New experimental support for user-supplied annotations. 
				TopHat will accept a GFF file, and will look for junctions 
				contained in the GFF file.  TopHat will also perform a basic 
				RPKM calculation on the regions in the annotation, normalized 
				to those annotations only (rather than the whole map).  The 
				file must contain "gene", "exon" and "mRNA" records, in the 
				normal record ID, Parent heirarchy.  Users are encouraged to 
				treat GFF support as unstable and interpret their results with
				caution.</li>
			<li>Several minor bugfixes.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p> TopHat 0.8.1 uses some code kindly provided by <a
        href="http://math.berkeley.edu/~rbradley/">Robert Bradley</a>. The
        code originally came from Rob's statistical alignment package <a href=
        "http://fsa.sourceforge.net/">FSA</a>. </p>
		</ul>	
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>0.8.0 release - 1/19/2009</h2>
		 <p> This release contains the following enhancements and fixes:
		 <ul>
			<li>Dramatic reduction in false positives.</li>
			<li>TopHat now estimates a minor isoform frequency for each splice
				junction, and filters infrequent events to cut down dramatically
				on the false positives. By default, minor isoforms must occur
				at at least 15 percent of the major isoform.</li>
			<li>The new output file coverage.wig is a UCSC wigglegram of alignment
				coverage.</li>
			<li>TopHat supports multithreading, though not all stages of the 
				pipeline use multiple threads.</li>
			<li>TopHat now allows reads to have multiple alignments, and it
				suppresses alignments for reads that have more than a user-specified
				number (10, by default).</li>
			<li>The memory exhaustion problem associated with converting 
				Bowtie alignments to Maq has been fixed.</li>
			<li>You are no longer required to concatenate your reads into a 
				single input file.</li>
			<li>TopHat will attempt to automatically determine seed length,
				quality scale, and FASTA/FASTQ format from your input reads.</li>
			<li>If you are missing a Maq binary fasta file for your reference,
				one will be created in the output directory 
				using <tt>bowtie-inspect</tt>.  You can copy this file to the
				location of your bowtie index to avoid this step in your next 
				run.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		</ul>	
		</p>
		<br/>
		<h2>0.7.2 release - 12/05/2008</h2>
		 <p> The following issues have been fixed:
		 <ul>
			<li>Bowtie 0.9.8 renamed <tt>bowtie-convert</tt> to 
				<tt>bowtie-maqconvert</tt>, and TopHat is now compatible with 
				both the new and old name.</li>
			<li>Minor cosmetic improvements in the TopHat output log.</li>
			<li>Improved checking in the installer to emit sensible error 
				messages when compiling on Solaris.  Solaris is currently not
				supported, but hopefully will be in the next release.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p> Known issues:
		<ul>
			<li>TopHat can exhaust memory when run with many (> 50 million) 
				reads on some machines.  This will be fixed in the next release. </li>
		</ul>	
		</p>
		<br/>
	  <h2>0.7.1 release - 11/08/2008</h2>
	  <p> The following issues have been fixed:
		<ul>
			<li>Maq 0.7.0 changed the Maq map file format.  Bowtie 0.9.7 now 
				supports both the new and old mapping format, and thus so now
				does TopHat.  
				TopHat now checks the version of Maq on the system and uses the
				correct format. </li>
			<li>Minor command line interface improvements</li>
			<li>The <tt>-X</tt> option has been added to allow the use of FASTQ
				files that are scaled on the Solexa quality scale, as opposed
				to Phred (the default).  Note that TopHat doesn't support FASTQ-int,
				only ASCII-encoded qualities are used.
			<li>The <tt>-D</tt> option has been added, allowing users to 
				specify when to look for junctions within single islands, as 
				opposed to just between two distinct islands</li>
			<li>The <tt>-Q</tt> option allows the user to specify a Phred quality character
				below which the island consensus caller will use the reference 
				base call.  That is, TopHat will not allow SNPs to be called
				where base quality drops below a certain threshold.
			<li>TopHat now includes Heng Li's <tt>fq_all2std.pl</tt> format
				conversion script to make installation easier.</li>
		</ul>

      <h2>0.7.0 release - 10/27/08</h2>
      
      <p> The first public release of TopHat is now available for download.
      To use TopHat, you will need to install <a
      href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net">Bowtie</a> and <a
      href="http://maq.sourceforge.net">Maq</a>. Both are open source and
      freely available under the Artistic license.
      When you install Bowtie, you should also install the Bowtie index for
      the genome in your RNA-Seq experiment, if one is available. If there is
      no pre-built index for the organism you're interested in, you can follow
      the Bowtie manual's section on <a href="http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/manual.html#indx">how to build one yourself</a>. </p>
      
	  <p> Because this is the first release, the manual is very limited. Only the
		basic options have been described. However, we will be updating it frequently,
		so please check back. If you find something unclear, or have questions about
		how TopHat works, please email <a href="mailto:cole@cs.umd.edu">Cole
		Trapnell</a>.  We will be posting a list of frequently asked questions soon.  
	
		<p> In this release, TopHat <strong>does not consider mate pairing</strong>
			between reads. You can analyze paired-end RNA-Seq data with TopHat, but the
			program won't make use of the mate information. Yet. Use of mate pair
			information is our <strong>top development priority</strong>.  
			Check back soon for a release with full paired-end support
